<p>A track in the NWDI can be configured to be built with a
different JDK than the NWDI is executed on.</p>
<p>When configuring the NWDI one can define the 'JDK_1_3_1_HOME' and
'JDK_1_4_2_HOME' to point to older JDK installation that can be used to
build tracks that point to older NetWeaver installation.</p>
<p>Provide the path to such an installation or leave the field empty
when you don't intend to build tracks for NetWeaver 7.0.x.</p>
